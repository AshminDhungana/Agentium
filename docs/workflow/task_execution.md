# 🏛️ Agentium – Advanced Task Governance & Execution Architecture (Done) [Verify at the End]

---

# 🎯 Objective

Design and enforce a **production-grade autonomous task lifecycle system** fully aligned with:

- Constitutional Governance
- Hierarchical Agent Orchestration
- Critic-Based Judicial Validation
- Dual Storage Knowledge Sovereignty
- Multi-Channel Synchronization
- Self-Healing Execution Loops
- Democratic Oversight

If any described mechanism is partially implemented or missing, implement or refactor accordingly.

---

# 🧠 I. Foundational Architectural Upgrade

Agentium already has governance.
This upgrade formalizes **Task as a Constitutional Entity**.

## 🔷 Core Principle

> Every task is a governed citizen of the AI Nation.

Tasks must:

- Be constitutionally valid
- Be democratically accountable
- Be judicially reviewable
- Be auditable
- Be recoverable
- Be auto-optimized

---

# 🏗️ II. Task Lifecycle Governance Model

## 1️⃣ Task Entity Structure (PostgreSQL – Source of Truth)

As per the Project setup

---

# ⚖️ III. Governance Flow Per Task Type

## A. 🧍 User One-Time Task

### Flow

1. User → Head (0xxxx)

2. Head performs:
   - Intent validation
   - Constitutional Guard check
   - Risk classification

3. If unclear:
   - Short clarification message (≤ 2 lines)
   - Stored in conversation memory

4. Head forwards to Council if:
   - Resource intensive
   - Constitutional impact
   - Strategic change

5. Council Vote (if required)
   - Stored immutably
   - Requires quorum

6. Lead (2xxxx) assigned

7. Lead creates execution DAG

8. Plan Critic (6xxxx) validates DAG

9. If approved → Task Agents (3xxxx) spawned

10. Execution loop:
    - Code Critic
    - Output Critic
    - Checkpoint Service

11. Aggregation → Head

12. Head returns short completion message

---

## B. 🔁 Recurring Task (Constitutional Recurrence Model)

Recurring tasks must include:

```sql
recurrence_policy {
    frequency: weekly | monthly | cron
    auto_renew: boolean
    sovereign_review_required: boolean
    next_execution_at
}
```

### Additional Governance Rules

- Recurring tasks auto-execute via Celery scheduler
- Once per governance cycle (weekly/monthly):
  - Head sends summary of recurring tasks
  - User may stop/modify

- Recurring tasks require:
  - Output Quality Monitoring
  - Drift detection
  - Auto-optimization review

---

## C. 🛠️ System Tasks (Internal Sovereign Maintenance)

Created by:

- Head (Executive)
- Constitutional Patrol
- Optimization Agents

Examples:

- Task cleanup (>30 days completed)
- Knowledge deduplication
- Idle agent liquidation
- Index rebuilding
- Security audits

System tasks:

- Do NOT require Council vote
- Are logged
- Are visible in audit dashboard

---

# 🔄 IV. Self-Healing Execution Loop

If task fails:

1. Mark `failed`
2. Store structured failure reason
3. Trigger:

```
Review Phase:
    Lead analyzes failure
    Plan refinement
    Retry execution
```

Max retries: 5
If still failing → escalate to Council
Council decides:

- Liquidate
- Modify scope
- Allocate more resources

All retries logged.

---

# 🧠 V. Knowledge Integration (RAG Governance)

Before major execution:

Agents must query:

1. PostgreSQL:
   - Similar past tasks
   - Failure history
   - Vote patterns

2. ChromaDB:
   - Past learnings
   - Constitution embeddings
   - Best practices

3. Self Reasoning:
   - Ethos is the working memory of the agent.
   - Ethos should be updated during self reasoning
   - Example for Update:
     - Read the constituion - Append to ethos
     - Recive the task - Append to ethos
     - Self Reasoning - Append to ethos
     - Steps do do - Append to ethos
     - Steps complited - append to ethos
     - What to do next - append to ethos
   - Continues Resoning Untill Task Complition
   - If Resoning Stops due to some reason Trigger a prompt to summurize the ongoing task and start again untill the task compliton.

Agents must answer internally:

> “Has this been done before?”
> “Was it constitutional?”
> “What failed last time?”

---

# 🧹 VI. Data Retention & Sovereign Optimization

System Optimization Agent runs daily:

- Delete completed tasks older than 30 days
- Remove orphan embeddings
- Compress execution logs
- Archive constitutional history
- Remove ethos of deleted agents

Must maintain:

- Referential integrity
- Audit trail snapshot

---

# 🔌 VII. Multi-Channel Sovereign Sync

## Centralized Conversation Authority

All messages must:

- Be stored in PostgreSQL Conversation table
- Be event-driven via Redis
- Be broadcast via WebSocket Hub
- Sync to:
  - Dashboard
  - WhatsApp
  - Slack
  - Telegram

One user → One unified conversation state.
No channel-specific divergence allowed.

---

# 💬 VIII. Communication Policy (Critical)

All chat responses:

- Max 2–3 lines
- No internal architecture exposure
- No technical explanation
- No governance mechanics discussion
- Only clear action results

Example:

❌ "The task was delegated to a lead agent and reviewed by critics."
✅ "Task completed successfully."

---

# 🧬 IX. Advanced Structural Improvements (Research-Based)

## 1. Event-Sourcing Model (Recommended)

Instead of mutable task states:

Store:

```
TaskCreated
TaskDeliberated
TaskApproved
TaskChunkExecuted
TaskFailed
TaskRetried
TaskCompleted
```

Reconstruct task state from event history.

Benefits:

- Full time travel
- Complete audit trace
- Constitutional compliance tracking

---

## 2. State Machine Enforcement

Each task must follow strict state transitions:

```
pending → deliberating → approved → running
running → completed
running → failed → retrying → running
retrying → escalated
```

Illegal transitions blocked.

---

## 3. Load-Based Auto-Scaling Governance

Lead Agents monitor:

- Queue depth
- Average execution time
- Critic backlog
- Memory usage

If threshold exceeded:

- Request Council micro-vote
- Spawn additional 3xxxx agents
- Auto-liquidate oldest idle agents

---

# 🔐 X. Constitutional Safety Guarantees

- Task Agents cannot spawn agents
- Critics cannot execute
- Council cannot bypass Critics
- Head cannot override Critics without Council supermajority (75%)
- System tasks cannot modify Constitution

---

# 🧩 XI. Final System Requirements Checklist

System must guarantee:

- Complete lifecycle tracking
- Democratic oversight
- Judicial veto enforcement
- Retry + escalation logic
- Recurring governance reviews
- Auto-cleanup >30 days
- Multi-channel sync integrity
- Immutable audit logging
- Knowledge-aware execution
- Sovereign constitutional validation

---

# 🚀 XII. Long-Term Evolution (Recommended)

Future research directions:

- Agent reputation scoring
- Predictive failure detection
- Constitutional simulation sandbox
- Governance stress-testing mode
- Multi-Agentium federation protocol
- AI-assisted constitutional amendment drafting

---

# 🏁 Final Mandate

Agentium must not behave like an assistant.

It must behave like:

> A sovereign AI nation executing constitutional intent through structured, accountable, auditable governance.

---

**Built for AI Sovereignty.
Built for Democratic Intelligence.
Built for Constitutional Autonomy.**
