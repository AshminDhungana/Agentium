# Agentium — Verification & Improvement Backlog


## 21. Production-Readiness Checklist

Mapped from common agent production-readiness frameworks (functional correctness, safety, cost, observability, resilience); verify each against Agentium's actual surfaces rather than assuming the roadmap claims hold.

- **21.1 — [P2] Functional correctness** — agent completes representative tasks end-to-end; tool-call parameters are valid against schema; multi-step context is retained across a task's lifetime; output format/schema compliance is enforced; agent falls back gracefully when uncertain rather than hallucinating a result.
  - [ ] **21.1.1 — End-to-End Task Execution Verification**: Test representative end-to-end agent task workflows (e.g. multi-tool execution via `agent_orchestrator.py` & `workflow_executor.py`) to confirm task completion without stalling or early termination.
  - [ ] **21.1.2 — Tool-Call Schema & Parameter Validation**: Verify pre-execution schema validation (Pydantic / JSON Schema validation for MCP tools, internal tools, and `tool_factory.py`) to catch and reject invalid parameters before invocation.
  - [ ] **21.1.3 — Multi-Step Context & State Retention**: Verify context retention across multi-turn task lifetimes (`chat_context.py`, `context_manager.py`, `checkpoint_service.py`), ensuring history pruning or summarization preserves essential task variables.
  - [ ] **21.1.4 — Output Format & Schema Compliance Enforcement**: Verify structured response formatting (Pydantic models, JSON schema parsing) with auto-retry or re-prompting mechanisms when LLM output violates required schema.
  - [ ] **21.1.5 — Graceful Uncertainty Fallback & Anti-Hallucination**: Verify agent uncertainty triggers (`clarification_service.py`, fallback handling) when tool outputs are missing or ambiguous, ensuring agent requests clarification rather than hallucinating results.
- **21.2 — [P0] Safety & constraints** — constitutional guard tuning (see 17.2); resistance to prompt injection from user-provided documents; no PII leakage across user sessions or privilege levels; tool/action scope stays within the calling agent's tier.
- **21.3 — [P2] Cost & resource controls** — token-budget enforcement (`DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET_USD` per Phase 13.3); detection of runaway/looping tool calls; cost-per-query stays within the selected model's expected range; rate-limit backoff on provider errors.
- **21.4 — [P2] Observability** — every agent step emits structured logs (timestamp, request_id, step, duration, tokens, status); errors carry enough context to debug without reproducing; metrics and traces correlate by `request_id`.
- **21.5 — [P2] Production readiness** — graceful degradation when the LLM, DB, or search provider fails (Phase 13.2); load-tested at 2× expected peak; rollback to a prior version completes in under 5 minutes (config Git versioning per Phase 16.4, `POST /admin/rollback`); an incident-response runbook exists and is current.

## 22. Log & Audit Verification

- **22.1 — [P2]** Verify structured logging fields are present and consistent across all agent steps and Celery tasks — not just ad-hoc string logs in some code paths and structured logs in others.
- **22.2 — [P1]** Verify `AuditLog` entries are complete and immutable for every security-relevant action (privilege escalations, MCP tool invocations, auto-remediations) — this underpins the platform's core "auditable democracy" claim, so treat gaps here as high priority.
- **22.3 — [P2]** Verify slow-query log parsing (the Celery task that writes to `AuditLog`) actually populates `GET /admin/slow-queries` with real data, not an empty/stale response.
- **22.4 — [P2]** Verify frontend-caught errors actually reach `POST /frontend/errors` and surface in `MonitoringPage.tsx` (Phase 14.3 claim).

## 23. Dependency Updates

- **23.1 — [P2]** Scan `backend/requirements*.txt` for EOL, deprecated, or known-vulnerable packages (e.g. via `pip-audit` or `safety`); update with pinned versions and re-run the full test suite.
- **23.2 — [P2]** Scan `sdk/python/pyproject.toml` the same way; confirm build + `pytest` remain green after updates.
- **23.3 — [P2]** Scan `frontend/package.json` + lockfile for deprecated/abandoned dependencies (e.g. unmaintained animation/utility libs); update and re-run `npm run build` + the a11y CI gate.
- **23.4 — [P3]** Check `docker-compose.yml` base images for newer security patches; bump and re-test the full stack.
